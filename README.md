# bayesian hackathon

Four datasets to play with for a hackathon to practice skills learnt at the Deakin Bayesian Statistics Worshop 2022







DATASET 1: homerange size of red fox

  source: Main et al 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13115)

  Whats in there:
  
    a) "MAIN_foxes_readme.txt" original documentation of the dataset
    
    b) "fox_data.csv" the dataset
    
    c) "Dataset1_redFoxHomeRange.R" code to read it and a couple of data explorations
    
    d) "fox_code.R" code to replicate the analyses presented in the paper
    
    e) "Main et al 2020.pdf" Original paper published in Div&Dist

  Suggested analysis: Gaussian (log) regression





DATASET 2: Birds distributions in South-East Canada

  source: Elith et al 2020 (https://doi.org/10.17161/bi.v15i2.13384)
  
  Whats in there:
  
    a) "CanadianBirdDistributions.R" code to read it and a couple of data explorations
    
    b) "Elith et al_BI_2020.pdf" Original paper published in Biodiv. Informatics
    
    c) "rasters_Can.zip" compressed file with the original rasters of the environmental predictors 
    (note that altitude was not included as raster but it still is present in the extracted values)
    
  
  Suggested analysis: Bernoulli (logit) regression
  




DATASET 3: Phyllogenetic signal on birds susceptibility to avian influenza in Australia

  source: Wille et al preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.14.480463)
  
  Whats in there:
  
    a) "2022.02.14.480463v1.full.pdf" Original (preprint) paper published in bioRxiv.
    
    b) "birddata.csv" Original birds species dataset

    c) "phylogeneticTree_allSpecies.nwk" phylogenetic tree
    
    c) "Dataset3_AvianInfluenza.R" code to read it, clean it and a couple of data explorations
    
    d) "birddata_clean.csv" model ready version of the dataset 
  
  Suggested analysis: Bernoulli (logit) regression for A
  
    
    
    
  

DATASET 4: roosting time standing on one leg for 9 bird species

  source: Julia and Matt Symonds
  
  Whats in there:
  
    a) "Roostingdata.csv" original dataset - whats in there is unclear
  
  Suggested analysis: ??
